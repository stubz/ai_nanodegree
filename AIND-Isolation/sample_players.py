        Notes
        -----
            (1) You MUST use the `self.score()` method for board evaluation
                to pass the project tests; you cannot call any other evaluation
                function directly.

            (2) If you use any helper functions (e.g., as shown in the AIMA
                pseudocode) then you must copy the timer check into the top of
                each helper function or else your agent will timeout during
